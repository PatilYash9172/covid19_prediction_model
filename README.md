COVID-19 Data Science Dashboard (India)

## ⭐ Executive Summary

This project showcases an **end-to-end Data Analytics solution** developed to monitor and visualize the COVID-19 pandemic's impact across India. I **engineered** an interactive web dashboard using the **Python-Dash ecosystem**, transforming raw, complex public data into **actionable, real-time insights**. The primary focus was on applying robust data science techniques (EDA, Time-Series Analysis, and Forecasting) to identify critical epidemic trends and support data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Key Achievements & Deliverables

This dashboard serves as a comprehensive portfolio piece, demonstrating expertise in the full data science lifecycle:

* **Engineered Scalable Dashboard:** **Developed and deployed** a highly interactive web dashboard using **Dash** and **Plotly** for dynamic user exploration and visualization.
* **Time-Series Modeling:** **Implemented** a time-series framework (`covid19_prediction_model.py`) to calculate and plot crucial trends, including **7-Day Moving Averages** and **Daily Growth Rates**.
* **Geospatial Insights:** **Leveraged** Plotly to create a **Choropleth Map**, providing immediate geospatial context to the distribution of confirmed cases across Indian states.
* **Robust Data Wrangling:** **Utilized Pandas** to collect, clean, and pre-process national and state-level COVID-19 data from public APIs, ensuring data integrity for analysis.
* **Demonstrated Full Stack Capability:** Showcases proficiency in front-end (Dash layout), back-end (Python data processing), and deployment (Git/GitHub workflow).
